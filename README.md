# Quickstart

Use the following commands to try to get it running on your machine:

0. First make a python virtual environment and install packages:

`python -m venv e_venv`
Replace e_venv with anything, it's just the name we're giving.


`source e_venv/bin/activate`
Activate Env. Might look different on Windows.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Install packages.

1. Run locally:
`flask run app`
